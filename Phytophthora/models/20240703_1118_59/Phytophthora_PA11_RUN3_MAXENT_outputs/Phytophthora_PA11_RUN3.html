<br> This page contains some analysis of the Maxent model for Phytophthora_PA11_RUN3, created Wed Jul 03 11:25:01 CEST 2024 using Maxent version 3.4.4.  If you would like to do further analyses, the raw data used here is linked to at the end of this page.<br>
<br><HR><H2>Analysis of omission/commission</H2>
The following picture shows the omission rate and predicted area as a function of the cumulative threshold.  The omission rate is is calculated both on the training presence records, and (if test data are used) on the test records.  The omission rate should be close to the predicted omission, because of the definition of the cumulative threshold.

<br> The next picture is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the same data.  Note that the specificity is defined using predicted area, rather than true commission (see the paper by Phillips, Anderson and Schapire cited on the help page for discussion of what this means).  This implies that the maximum achievable AUC is less than 1.  If test data is drawn from the Maxent distribution itself, then the maximum possible test AUC would be 0.802 rather than 1; in practice the test AUC may exceed this bound.

Some common thresholds and corresponding omission rates are as follows.  If test data are available, binomial probabilities are calculated exactly if the number of test samples is at most 25, otherwise using a normal approximation to the binomial.  These are 1-sided p-values for the null hypothesis that test points are predicted no better than by a random prediction with the same fractional predicted area.  The "Balance" threshold minimizes 6 * training omission rate + .04 * cumulative threshold + 1.6 * fractional predicted area.<br>
